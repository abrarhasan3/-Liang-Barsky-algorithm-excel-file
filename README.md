# Liang_Barsky_algorithm_Computer_Graphics
The aim of this project is to implement the Lian-Barsky algorithm for line clipping in computer graphics using Microsoft Excel. This tool will enable users to input window points and line points, and the algorithm will determine and display the clipped line segments within the specified window.<b> See the tutorial section(below) for better understanding.</b>




## Features

- Automatic mathmatical calculation
- Just need to insert the Window Coordinates and Line Coordinates
- Easy To Use

## Expected Benefits:

- Provides an easy-to-use tool for line clipping against a rectangular window.
- Enhances user understanding of the Lian-Barsky Algorithm in the context of computer graphics.
- Serves as an educational resource and practical utility for students and professionals in the field.
